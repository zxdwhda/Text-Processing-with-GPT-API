# Text-Processing-with-GPT-API
This project aims to automate the process of splitting large text files into smaller chunks, processing each chunk through an external GPT API with specific prompts, and then merging the processed chunks back into a single file. It provides a robust solution for efficiently handling large datasets that need to be processed by AI models.
